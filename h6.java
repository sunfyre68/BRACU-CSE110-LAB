// Write the Java code of a program that finds the sum of the first 100 positive numbers. You can verify your answer by calculating this sum manually.
//[Do NOT use loops, use the mathematical formula for calculating sum of arithmetic series given below].
//
//Note:
//S = n‚ÅÑ2 (a + L), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term and L is the last term.
